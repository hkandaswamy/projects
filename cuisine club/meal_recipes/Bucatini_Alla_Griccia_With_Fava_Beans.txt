ESTIMATED PREP TIME: 30 minutes

1. Place peppercorns in a bag, close, and coarsely crush with a rolling pin or heavy skillet (alternatively, you can crush them directly on a cutting board set inside a large rimmed baking sheet). 

2. Slice guanciale into ¼"-thick slabs, then slice slabs crosswise into ¼"-thick matchsticks.

3. If using fresh fava beans, cook in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender (the best way to gauge doneness is to check one; be sure to slip it from its skin before tasting!), about 3 minutes. 

4. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl of ice water; let cool. Drain and peel away outer skin from each bean; discard skins. Reserve pot with boiling water for cooking pasta.

5. Place guanciale in a dry large Dutch oven or other heavy pot and set over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. 

6. Add crushed peppercorns and stir once to combine. 

7. Add 1 cup hot tap water (using pasta cooking liquid here could make the dish too salty) and bring to a boil. Remove pot from heat and stir mixture aggressively to emulsify. Let sit until pasta is done.

8. Return reserved pot of water to a boil and cook pasta, stirring occasionally (if using frozen fava beans, add about 2 minutes before pasta is done), until al dente. 

9. Drain pasta and fava beans.

10. Done!
